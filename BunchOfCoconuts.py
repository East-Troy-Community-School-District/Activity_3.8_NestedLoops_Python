Instructions:
Trace the program and predict what it
will display. Then run the program to
check your work. As you may have noticed,
while you can nest while loops, it gets
very messy! Modify the program so that it
uses for loops instead of while loops.

i = 0
while i < 4:
    print("I have a lovely bunch of coconuts standing in a row.")
    j = 0
    while j < 3:
        print("Big ones, small ones...")
        j += 1
    i += 1
print("Some as big as your head!")
